# Openstack Deployment using Ansible Playbook on Physical multi-node environment
  Here are the scripts to deploy openstack on a multi-node environemnt
  Details are- 
  1. Openstack Mitaka Relaease
  2. Controller, Network, Compute multi-node deployment mode supported.
  3. Installs heat and Magnum openstack components as well.
  
Steps-
  1. Just clone the directory to a machine where ansible is installed and make sure password-less authentication is there between ansible server and the hosts.
  2. Open the host file and change the host entires as per the environment
  3. ansible-playbook -i host site.yml

# OpenStack on Ansible with Vagrant (unofficial)

## Note: this isn't the official OpenStack-Ansible project

You almost certainly want [openstack/openstack-ansible][1] instead, which
is the official OpenStack-Ansible project.

[1]: https://github.com/openstack/openstack-ansible

## Overview

This repository contains script that will deploy OpenStack into Vagrant virtual
machines. These scripts are based on the [Official OpenStack
Docmentation](http://docs.openstack.org/), havana release, except where
otherwise noted.


See also [Vagrant, Ansible and OpenStack on your laptop]
(http://www.slideshare.net/lorinh/vagrant-ansible-and-openstack-on-your-laptop)
on SlideShare, though this refers to a much older version of this repo and so is
now out of date.

## Install prereqs

You'll need to install:

* [Vagrant](http://vagrantup.com)
* [Ansible](http://ansible.github.com)
* [python-netaddr](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/netaddr/)
* [python-novaclient](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/python-novaclient) (recommended)

To install Ansible and the other required Python modules:

	pip install ansible netaddr python-novaclient


## (Optional) Speed up your provisioning

Install [Vagrant-cachier](http://fgrehm.viewdocs.io/vagrant-cachier) plugin:

    vagrant plugin install vagrant-cachier

It allow to share a local directory containing packages (Apt, Npm, â€¦) cache
among VMs.


## Get an Ubuntu 12.04 (precise) Vagrant box

Download a 64-bit Ubuntu Vagrant box:

	vagrant box add precise64 http://files.vagrantup.com/precise64.box

## Grab this repository

This repository uses a submodule that contains some custom Ansible modules for
OpenStack, so there's an extra command required after cloning the repo:

    git clone http://github.com/openstack-ansible/openstack-ansible.git
    cd openstack-ansible
    git submodule update --init

## Bring up the cloud

    make

This will boot three VMs (controller, network, storage, and a compute node),
install OpenStack, and attempt to boot a test VM inside of OpenStack.

If everything works, you should be able to ssh to the instance from any
of your vagrant hosts:

 * username: `cirros`
 * password: `cubswin:)`

Note: You may get a "connection refused" when attempting to ssh to the instance.
It can take several minutes for the ssh server to respond to requests, even
though the cirros instance has booted and is pingable.

## Vagrant hosts

The hosts for the standard configuration are:

 * 10.1.0.2 (our cloud controller)
 * 10.1.0.3 (compute node #1)
 * 10.1.0.4 (the quantum network host)
 * 10.1.0.5 (the swift storage host)

You should be able to ssh to these VMs (username: `vagrant`, password:
`vagrant`). You can also authenticate  with the vagrant private key, which is
included here as the file `vagrant_private_key` (NOTE: git does not manage file
permissions, these must be set to using "chmod 0600 vagrant_private_key" or ssh
and ansible will fail with an error).

## Interacting with your cloud

You can interact with your cloud directly from your desktop, assuming that you
have the [python-novaclient](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/python-novaclient/)
installed.

Note that the openrc file will be created on the controller by default.
